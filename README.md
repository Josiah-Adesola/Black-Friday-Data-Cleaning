# Black-Friday-Data-Cleaning

Data cleaning is a very important process in Data analytics and science.

Data has to be preprocessed before it is been served into a model.

I cleaned this black friday dataset from kaggle website.

The cleaning process involves:

Finding missing values

Replacing the missing values

Restructuring categorical variables


Deleting unimportant columns 

These techniques are so vital to having the best prediction.
